# Design Patterns
#### This Repo to discuss some design patterns which provides a general reusable solution for the common problems that occur in software design.

## Introduction
- A design pattern provides a general reusable solution for the common problems that occur in software design.
- The pattern typically shows relationships and interactions between classes or objects.
- Design patterns are programming language independent strategies for solving a common problem.
- That means a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation.
- By using design patterns, you can make your code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.

## Goal
- Understand the purpose and usage of each design pattern in order to pick and implement the correct pattern.

## Example
- In many real-world situations, we want to create only one instance of a class. For example, there can be only one active president of a country at any given time. This pattern is called a Singleton pattern.
- Other software examples could be a single DB connection shared by multiple objects as creating a separate DB connection for every object is costly. Similarly, there can be a single configuration manager or error manager in an application that handles all problems instead of creating multiple managers.
